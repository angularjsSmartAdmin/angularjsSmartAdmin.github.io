# angularSmartAdmin
This project is for learning angularjs deeply by using it thorougly and also to learn usage of git repository.

Installation and documentation for this project will be ready in mean time.

This project is in initial stage, so it might take some time.

The code of this project is free for anyone to use.

I have kept the code as simple as a starter can understand.

This project's ui is based on bootstrap and material design.

With full front end website and development design, like form validations, alerts.

Also, I have used json file to get data using angularjs http get request so that it can provide real website feel with animations.

This project can also help you use jquery plugins in easiest way along with angularjs.
